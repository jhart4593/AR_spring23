function [rx] = hdCameraSimulator(rXI,S,P)
% hdCameraSimulator : Simulates feature location measurements from the
%                     quad's high-definition camera. 
%
%
% INPUTS
%
% rXI -------- 3x1 location of a feature point expressed in I in meters.
%
% S ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%        statek = State of the quad at tk, expressed as a structure with the
%                 following elements:
%                   
%                  rI = 3x1 position of CM in the I frame, in meters
% 
%                 RBI = 3x3 direction cosine matrix indicating the
%                       attitude of B frame wrt I frame
%
% P ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%  sensorParams = Structure containing all relevant parameters for the
%                 quad's sensors, as defined in sensorParamsScript.m 
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% rx --------- 2x1 measured position of the feature point projection on the
%              camera's image plane, in pixels.  If the feature point is not
%              visible to the camera (the ray from the feature to the camera
%              center never intersects the image plane, or the feature is
%              behind the camera), then rx is an empty matrix.
